**Pair Programming** is when two people write code together on one machine. This collaboration helps improve code quality, readability, and simplicity. Not only is it an on-the-fly code review, since it has two pairs of eyes looking it over, but it is also a form of design review, thereby beating regular code reviews on several fronts. Pairing also helps with Sprint progress by moving the focus to completing stories and limiting the WIP. There are too many other benefits to list in a short glossary entry.

Ironically, some of the earliest programming work (before it was called programming) was done in pairs: _“Betty Snyder and I, from the beginning, were a pair. And I believe that the best programs and designs are done by pairs, because you can criticise each other, and find each others errors, and use the best ideas.” -_ **_Jean Bartik, one of the original programmers of the ENIAC computer._** (source - https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)
