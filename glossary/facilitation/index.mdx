**Facilitation** is the art of helping a group of people reach agreement or understanding, without direct involvement in the process itself. In the game of Scrum, facilitation is explicitly required in the events of Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective. In addition, we would expect facilitation to be part of Product Backlog Refinement and whenever the opportunity arises.

Facilitators need:

- - Empathy
    - Patience
    - To stay Neutral - you're there to make sure that your group reach their own conclusions
    - Active Listening Skills
    - Understanding of Group Dynamics (see the Groan Zone picture)
    - ...and perhaps PhD üë©üèΩ‚Äçüéì in Behavioural Psychology

A good facilitator will always have an agenda or plan for an event. A great facilitator will allow the plan to float out the window and adlib if the group needs it.
