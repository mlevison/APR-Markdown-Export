**Kanban** isn't just a board that you find in JIRA or Trello. It is a method to help improve the flow of work through a system. A kanban board is one way to visualize the work in your system, but use of a board alone will not improve things. Kanban, done as intended, requires discipline and the habit of continuous experimental improvement of the system. (Strangely, it has this in common with all Agile approaches.)

In a kanban approach, the team visualize their work and then improve the flow with attention to:

- Limiting Work In Progress (aka WIP),
- Unblocking work
- Ensuring older items are addressed first
- ...

Kanban is process agnostic. You can use it with Agile or Scrum Teams, but also in traditional teams. The more you look into kanban, the more you will see that it has much in common with every other Agile approach.
