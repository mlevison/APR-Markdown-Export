In the over 20 years since the Agile Manifesto was written, we've seen Agile approaches applied in a large variety of fields outside of software development. Scrum has been used for sales, marketing, manufacturing, human resources, gas plant design and construction, academic research, schools... the list goes on.

Agile approaches lend themselves well to circumstances where:

- we have cross-functional teams,
- people are doing knowledge work (i.e. their work requires thinking, rather doing routine repetitive tasks),
- adapting to change helps as opposed to just following a plan,
- there is a common goal or purpose, often called a Product Vision,
- collaboration would help the team.

In many of these examples, the groups don't use Scrum itself, rather they invent their own flavour of Agile that works for them. Things that come up time and time again include:

- work in small chunks,
- start with a rough plan and assume it will change often,
- regularly examine what has been built and change the plan based on feedback,
- give control of the work to the team,
- make team improvement a core part of the work,
- make improving communication and collaboration a regular part of the work.

##### AGILE OUTSIDE OF SOFTWARE BOOKS

- [_Agile HR: Deliver Value in a Changing World of Work_](https://www.amazon.ca/Agile-HR-Deliver-Value-Changing/dp/178966585X/&tag=notesfromatoo-20) - Natal Dank, Riina Hellström
- [_Agile for Non-Software Teams_](https://3pvantage.com/afnst-book/) - Gil Broza - excellent solid work
- [_Building a House in the Garden - Agile lesson from constructing a house_](https://leanpub.com/OurHouseInTheGarden) - Yves Hanoulle -  this is a completely different angle. His first two books are about office work, this book is about how Yves learned from Agile in building a passive house. Caveat: I have access to draft notes the author isn't ready to publish yet, and is taking note of emails to get a sense of its time to publish.
- [_Hacking Marketing: Agile Practices to Make Marketing Smarter, Faster, and More Innovative_](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Marketing-Practices-Smarter-Innovative/dp/1119183170/&tag=notesfromatoo-20/&tag=notesfromatoo-20) – Scott Brinker 
- _[Office Lean](https://www.amazon.ca/Office-Lean-Understanding-Implementing-Administrative/dp/0367196646/&tag=notesfromatoo-20)_ - Ken Eakin - expensive, however it is also excellent
