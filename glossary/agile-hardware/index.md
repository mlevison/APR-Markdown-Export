excerpt: 'Agile approaches have taken over the world of software, because teams that deliver value'
---

Agile approaches have taken over the world of software, because teams that deliver value sooner with higher quality beat the slow. Hardware teams face challenges software teams do not: Cost of Fabricating new hardware; Lead time for new parts; Cost of Change; Lack of test automation Infrastructure; How to iterate on hardware components separately; Compliance; Proof of Safety, Dependancies; ...

The world of hardware today resembles the software of the early 2000's - we had only a few early unit test tools (JUnit 3, CruiseControl, VisualSourceSafe/CVS/RCS - shudder).
