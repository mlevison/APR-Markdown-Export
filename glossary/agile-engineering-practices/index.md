In my [workshops](/certified-scrum-agile-training), I often have people who are focused on the question: “How can I help my team go faster?”, or “How can we deliver this Product sooner?” Whenever anyone asks, my answer is always the same: “You must slow down to go fast.” I then often get some puzzled looks.

In software development, the single best way to improve quality, and eventually speed, is writing less code. Most of the time spent writing code should be to understand the problem and then find the simplest solution to it. The practices used to facilitate this in Agile software development are popularly known as **Agile Engineering Practices**.
