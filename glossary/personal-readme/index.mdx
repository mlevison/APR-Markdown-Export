Github style READMEs can be turned to personal use. A Personal README, aka Personal Manual, is a document that describes how a person likes to communicate (Slack, email, text message, …), their timezone, the hours they like to work, etc. Most include enough information that a new teammate knows a little bit about their new colleague on a personal level as well.

Having looked at 10–15 examples to write this glossary, I’ve noticed the following attributes:

- Preferred Communication channel - one person even said, “I prefer Slack but if I don’t respond in 24 hrs use email.”
- Collaboration - several people talk about how to collaborate. “If it requires more than one round of emails let’s do a zoom call.”
- How and when to book a meeting on this person’s calendar.
- Several had a “What makes me grumpy” section.
- Their thoughts around giving and receiving feedback.
- Leaders shared their management style.
- Another author shared his personal work history and how it shaped him.

_Are they needed? No. Are they fun? Yes. Do they give an avenue to sharing a bit more about yourself? Yes._
