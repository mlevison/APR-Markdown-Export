**Psychological safety** is about being part of a team and knowing that you can share ideas and information without fear. Psychological safety isn’t the avoidance of conflict, rather it is knowing that we can share information inside a team instead of focusing on protecting ourselves.

> "The belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes, and that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking" - Amy Edmondson, 1999

It isn't just trust. We can trust each other and not be safe. Psychological safety requires that we know that if we take a chance or make a mistake, that we will be supported and not punished.

As safety increases, communication within the team becomes more open. This openness leads to better awareness of what is really happening in the work environment.

As communication improves, mistakes are reported and fixed more rapidly.

It is a virtuous circle.

## What psychological safety isn't

Psychological safety isn't agreement for the sake of agreement. Rather, it's an environment where we know we can be honest about what we have seen and not be punished for it. Warning: safety isn't an excuse to highlight the mistakes we see in other people on our team. It is about being able to acknowledge our own mistakes and what we learned without repercussions.

Amy Edmonsen, who has written the book on the subject, uses the following survey to test a team’s level of safety:

1. If you make a mistake on this team, it is often held against you.
2. Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues.
3. People on this team sometimes reject others for being different.
4. It is safe to take a risk on this team.
5. It is difficult to ask other members of this team for help.
6. No one on this team would deliberately act in a way that undermines my efforts.
7. Working with members of this team, my unique skills and talents are valued and utilized.

People answer on a scale of Strongly Agree -> Strongly Disagree. Once the survey has been run, the team can use the data to help themselves see how they might evolve.

Timothy Clark - 2020 - has extended the concept to four levels: included; safe environment to learn; safe to contribute; safe to challenge the status quo.
