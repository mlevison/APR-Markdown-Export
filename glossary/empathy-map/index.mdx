**Empathy Maps** are a tool to help us record what we understand about our audience. The maps prompt the team to answer questions about what the users do, say, hear, see, etc. In the course of building the map the team gains greater empathy for the users.

All of this work is predicated on the idea that the team has conducted enough interviews with a range of end users to have sufficient data to draw on.
