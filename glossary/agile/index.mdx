**Agile** is a _mindset_ for doing work in a team environment that improves teamwork, professional performance, and adaptability. The Agile mindset is focused on adapting to changing customer needs while still delivering a high-quality product, and is defined by the values and principles in the [Agile Manifesto](external:https://agilemanifesto.org/).

There is no single way to put the Agile mindset into practice, and numerous approaches have been developed. **Scrum** is currently the world’s most popular approach.

Agile and Scrum are _not_ the same things.
