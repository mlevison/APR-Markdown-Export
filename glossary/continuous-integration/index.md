In software development, **Continuous Integration** is the practice of merging all developers' working code to the main or head branch several times a day. This makes other practices from Automated Builds -> Continuous Delivery possible. _Note: contrary to popular belief, Continuous Integration is the habit of frequent checkins and not the build automation. The automated builds are the supporting tools that make CI practical._

CI works by increasing the frequency of integration, so that most changes are small. Anything that works against that pattern (e.g. infrequent checkins, long-lived code branches, etc.) will harm the team and their code base.
