](/guide-to-effective-agile-retrospectives)The **Sprint Retrospective** is an event at the end of the [Sprint where the Scrum Team reflects on all that happened in that period, with the intention to improve how they work in the next Sprint.

Sprint Review and Retrospective are often confused. The Sprint Review is focused on the Product, Product Improvement, and feedback from Stakeholders/Customers. The Retrospective is focused on improving the team, their process and approach to the work.
