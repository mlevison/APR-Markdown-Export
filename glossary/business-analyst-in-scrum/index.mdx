In traditional approaches, the **Business Analyst** gathers the requirements months or years ahead of the team. Clearly that doesn't work in an Agile world. Scrum doesn't define any traditional roles inside the team: BA, QA, DBA, Dev, UX - instead everyone is a Developer or, better yet, a doer. This creates discomfort, but also opportunities.

_"What is the role of a BA on a scrum team? My team and their BA are struggling to know what falls on the PO responsibilities vs. what falls on the BA responsibilities."_

This question, or a variation of it, is one that often comes up in [training workshops](/certified-scrum-agile-training) and our [Lean Coffee sessions](/lean-coffee). Some options I've seen work well:

- BA is the Product Owner
- BA works inside the Scrum Team assisting the Product Owner flesh specific details. (This happens most often when there is one PO for multiple teams working on a single product, in which case the PO is focused on Product Strategy/Prioritization not PBIs/User Stories)
- BA participates with QA and Programmers to define acceptance criteria - in the BDD style
- BA [cross skills](/blog/how-to-cross-skill-and-grow-t-shaped-team-members) and helps with QA, this is a natural outgrowth of the previous step
- Some cross skill into UX work and, rarely, others cross skill to programming
