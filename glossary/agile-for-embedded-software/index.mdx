Embedded Software Development is about building software that is installed inside a device example: thermostat, car engine controller, planes, WiFi router, Bluetooth Keyboard/Mouse, Camera, Roomba Vacuums. Typically Embedded software works without a user interface and often without any human interaction. Embedded Software teams face challenges that other Agile teams typically don't face:

- The software once built may never be upgradeable
- It might run on a limited CPU and memory
- It will have high reliability and predictability requirements

To face these challenges
