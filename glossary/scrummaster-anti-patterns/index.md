An Anti-Pattern is a recurring pattern that frequently shows up, where the behaviour creates new problems somewhere else in the system. Example: the common practice of MicroManagement allows the MicroManager to feel like they’re maintaining control, yet their control reduces self-organization, creates disengagement, slows decision-making etc. So even though the MicroManager feels like they’re in control, their behaviour is damaging the system they’re part of.

Even the ScrumMaster can join in the AntiPattern fun:

- Doesn’t understand self-organization and so gives orders to the Team
- Doesn’t coach the Product Owner and so the Team continues to work without a Product Vision or Strategy
- ScrumMaster Role is combined with the Product Owner role - the roles have different focuses and skill sets. Few people are skilled in both Coaching a team and also bringing a Product to life
- Scrum Parent - ScrumMaster solves all the team’s problems for them
- Facilitator only - not realizing there is more to the role; the ScrumMaster facilitates meetings but puts no effort into coaching

[MicroManagement](https://agilepainrelief.com/blog/scrum-anti-patterns-micromanagement.html) is just one of the many general [Agile Anti Patterns](https://agilepainrelief.com/blog/scrum-anti-patterns.html) that we document.
