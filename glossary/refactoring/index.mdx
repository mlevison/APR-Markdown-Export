**Refactoring** is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behaviour. Refactoring is done to improve the simplicity and readability of a piece of code. Most refactorings are simple (e.g. rename method, extract method, etc) and have been automated by modern development tools to guarantee safety/correctness. A refactoring is like renaming a section header in a document to better convey the core idea to the reader, or splitting a large, unwieldy paragraph into smaller parts.
