**The SCARF Model** of human behaviour is useful to understand how people respond to the world through the lenses of **S**tatus, **C**ertainty, **A**utonomy, **R**elatedness, and **F**airness. In our case, we focus on how the model explains behaviour of people in the world of Agile work.

The model is based on three major findings:

- Social threats and rewards are treated with the same intensity as physical threats and rewards. _\- Eisenberger, N. and Lieberman, M. (2009)_
- Our ability to solve problems and make decisions is diminished when we're in a threat state, and increases when in a reward state. _\- Fredrickson, B. (2001)._
- People are more easily placed into Threat than Reward, so in our work we need to minimize the things that create Threat. _\- Baumeister, R., Bratslavsky, e., & Vohs, K. (2001)_

Being mentioned in the context of a problem.</td><td>Thanking someone or acknowledging their work. Any form of recognition.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Certainty:</strong></td><td>How confident you can be of the future.</td><td>Change - Agile or otherwise - takes away the certainty of the people involved.</td><td>Transparency of information around the change process.
