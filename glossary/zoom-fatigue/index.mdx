During the COVID-19 pandemic, we learned the hard way that being on Zoom, or any other video conferencing system, wears us down.

A few things we've learned can reduce the harm:

- Breaks between meetings help your brain reset - 5-10 mins
- Breaks need to be away from the computer - step outside; meditate; stretch - no screens
- Make meetings more intentional, effective, and shorter
- Our brains are not designed to see ourselves all day. Turn off the self view in your video tool.
