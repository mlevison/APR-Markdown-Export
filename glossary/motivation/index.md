Traditional approaches in the workplace assume that there is a strong linkage between **motivation** and financial reward. Theory is, if you pay people enough money, they will be engaged. Yet we know from watching everyone's favorite [Dan Pink video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc) that isn't the case. Don’t assume that you know what motivates - trust the research. Read psychologist Fredrick Herzberg's work. Specifically, how job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction are not opposites. The opposite of Satisfaction is No Satisfaction. The opposite of Dissatisfaction is No Dissatisfaction.

Below are resources that will point you in the right direction.  My advice to improving motivation and enagement in team members goes roughly like this:

1. Look for demotivators in your environment and clear those away. Otherwise other efforts will have little effect. Hint: if you're stuck, use [Systems Thinking](/glossary/systems-thinking)  as a lens. You're aiming for No Dissatisfaction, so you aren't pushing a rock uphill in an avalanche.
2. Look for opportunities to turn No Satisfaction into Satisfaction. We're talking about what research shows actually motivates: autonomy, mastery, purpose, recognition, etc.
3. Conduct one-on-ones on a regular basis with team members. Research will point you in the right general direction, but everyone is unique. Everyone wants to know they have a voice. [Make a safe place for your team](/glossary/psychological-safety) to be honest, then ask them what they need to feel motivated, and _listen_ when they tell you.
