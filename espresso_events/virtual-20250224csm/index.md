**Do you want to buy cheap training just so you can put the letters "CSM" after your name?** **Or do you want to invest to gain skills that will actually advance your team and career?**

### What makes us different than others?

**Most Scrum trainers treat you as a once and done. We’re here to help you do Scrum and enjoy the results, not just give you a certification.** There's quite a lot that makes us different from other training providers. But don’t take our word for it. Take a minute to consider the following….

"_My first Scrum training ever was with Mark for CSM. Sadly, my company at the time sent me elsewhere for A-CSM. **Nearly everything the other trainer taught in A-CSM had already been covered in Mark's CSM course or his follow-up material (which I still refer to to this day)**. Mark offers way more depth than anyone else in his training. I will definitely be going back to him for my CSP-SM!_" ~ Josh N.

## 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed

![certificate](images/noun-coaching-4190192.png)**Individual support** - Small class size – no more than 15 people. (Be aware that some trainers put 50 people in a class.) Answers to your “Yes, but in real life…” questions and concerns to solve your problems.

### Testimonials

"_I had the freedom to just listen and retain, understand and ask questions. I expected more lecture style and that wasn't the case which was awesome. **This Scrum master course was exactly what I needed to feel supported and reassured that I can do this!** The teaching style, the small groups and the activities made a huge difference in making me feel supported and empowered to become a scrum master. I am so grateful for this course._" ~ Nicole G.

"_One of the best on-line courses I have taken. This course was REALLY good (I don't often say that!). **It could have easily have been death-by-powerpoint, but instead the course was engaging and fun!** Using a variety of online tools, we explored Scrum both on a broad surface level, then with deep dives into particular areas as voted for by the class. Mark made sure that everyone was satisfied with their own personal understanding before closing a particular topic. Thank you, Mark! I am very excited to take Scrum to my organization and create a high performance team!_" ~ Ross H.

"_Anyone looking to do this course...do it with Mark! His passion for all things Scrum and Agile shines through and excites his students. He’s a scrum realist with a fantastic sense of humour! The material is relevant today and Mark gives us a glimpse of what we can expect 5 years from now. **The post class support is fantastic** and shows how passionate and knowledgeable Mark is about learning! A true educator!_" ~ Roberta P.

**We have _thousands_ of quotes and testimonials from people who have enjoyed and benefited from our training.** [Let us know](/contact-us "Contact Us") if you would like to read even more.
