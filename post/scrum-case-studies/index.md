![stack of folders - image licensed from Photodune](src/content/blog/scrum-case-studies/images/photodune-744861-folders-xs.jpg)I've recently been asked by one team to provide them with case studies/success stories about Scrum to prove scrum works. It is striking that the people ask for case studies about agile - but didn't before adopting their existing process.

Ken Schwaber co-creator of Scrum has: Primavera Success Story (pdf) a paper that describes Primavera's struggles with waterfall and then their transition to Scrum (with XP engineering practices). Key message: Scrum works for Primavera, but changing the process isn't easy.

[Stuart Read](https://merkleinc.ch/themen-trends), Professor of Marketing at IMD in Lausanne Switzerland has written a case study about Guidewire (pdf) - a insurance billing company that is built **entirely** around Scrum.

On InfoQ (_caveat emptor I'm an InfoQ editor_) there are a number of case studies:

- [Scrum Boosts Effectiveness at the BBC](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Scrum-bbc-newmedia/) (presentation), "In this conference talk Andrew Scotland tells how BBC's New Media division, characterized by a lot of uncertainty and emergent software process, decided to use Scrum to more effectively deliver software amidst all that change and uncertainty. Three years later - the difference is significant, and the journey was worthwhile."
- [Case study: Distributed Scrum Project for Dutch Railways](https://www.infoq.com/articles/dutch-railway-scrum/) - focused on how one group has made a necessary evil (distributed teams) work, this case study is also a good example of how Scrum works
- [Improvement, Success and Failure: Scrum Adoption in China](https://www.infoq.com/articles/Agile-adoption-study-china/) - an interesting Q&A. The questions around failures are very interesting: Training is critical and doing Scrum-but will eventually kill.
- Henrik Kniberg's famous "[Scrum an XP from the Trenches](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2/)" a 168 page ebook (free) that describes how one team does scrum.

UIE a usability website has: [The Freedom of Fast Iterations: How Netflix Designs a Winning Web Site](https://articles.uie.com/fast_iterations/) - while not strictly a Scrum case study Netflix does use Agile methods.

Obviously Ken's book [Agile Project Management with Scrum](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Project-Management-Microsoft-Professional/dp/073561993X/&tag=notesfromatoo-20) is a series of case studies.

DDJ has [Embedded Agile: A Case Study In Numbers](https://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/embedded-agile-a-case-study-in-numbers/193501924) an article that demonstrates Agile working in the embedded environment. Timo Punkka documents Schneider-Electric's adoption of Scrum for embedded software development.

Rally has a number of [Customer Case Studies](https://www.broadcom.com/case-studies) \- Caveat Emptor while interesting they were written to prove that Rally can help you transition to Agile - so they tend to be slick and focused on Rally benefits. Net result - they're a wee bit light on specifics. They also have [Agile Impact Paper](https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/idc-marketscape-agile-ppm-vendor-assessment) written by IDC - good paper about the impact - but what a pain to download - I'm surprised I wasn't asked how many children I have.

Finally Frank Maurer, a professor at U Calgary has: Agile Software Development: An Industrial Case Study with data showing increased productivity.

Google reveals many more case studies - but if the above weren't sufficient then no case study will help convince. Finally I suggest stop reading case studies, take action. Get some training, find a mentor and start. Your first few iterations will not be your best but you will improve with time.

_Update: Added Case Studies from Mishkin and Rally. Latest additions Keith's efforts and Timo's embedded paper. Added samples from Danube._
