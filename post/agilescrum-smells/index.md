![Sniffing dog- image licensed from Photodune](src/content/blog/agilescrum-smells/images/sniffing-dog-xs.jpg) In 2003 Mike Cohn started this project with a paper entitled: [Toward a Catalog of Scrum Smells](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/articles/toward-a-catalog-of-scrum-smells) (pdf - in the spirit of [Code Smells](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html)) and last year Rowan Bunning did a presentation Sharing More than Deodorant for Scrum Smells (pdf). Rowan encouraged me to create a wiki with all of these smells. So I've spent some time in the past few days fleshing out this Catalog.Â  These are a series of simple patterns that describe a problem and then offer some potential solutions.

As it stands today the [Catalog](https://scrumcommunity.pbwiki.com/Scrum+Smells) contains nearly 20 smells:

But to improve this we need you help:

- Proofreading
- Most smells need a better discussion
- Most smells are missing case studies
- More smells

Sample Smell:

## Nothing Ever Gets Better Around Here

#### 1\. Smells

- Retrospective doesn't happen
- No actionable items generated from Retrospective
- Actions aren't taken
- Non-team members attend the meeting
- No one wants to talk
- The same issues come up time after time

#### 2\. Discussion

If we're not continuously improving we're not really Agile. So what happened?

#### 3\. Causes

- Action Items if they exist, don't have owners.
- Action Items get forgotten as soon as the Retrospective is over

#### 4\. Consequences

- Team fails to improve

#### 5\. Prevention

#### 6\. Example Remedies

- After discussing issues - ask team members to suggest concrete actions (see [Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great](https://pragprog.com/titles/dlret/agile-retrospectives/) for some great ideas).
- Ensure that action items are small and achievable.
- Ask a for one volunteer to own each action item.
- Action items can't be assigned to people not present at the meeting.
- Discuss action items as part of the daily standup - at least a few times during the iteration.
- Post action items in a highly visible location

#### 7\. Case Studies
