Always chasing little scraps of paper around the office? Then consider ["My Life Organized" (MLO)](external:https://www.mylifeorganized.net/) as a task manager.

This is a very short review because I know I have another five tasks to achieve before I shutdown my computer tonight. How do I know that I have five tasks? Because I use a combination of [David Allen's "Getting Things Done"](external:https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/&tag=notesfromatoo-20) (GTD) system and "My Life Organized" (MLO).

In a nutshell MLO is task outliner. It allows you keep track of all of the things you want to do now, tomorrow and ever. The outliner looks and works like the windows folder system. If that was all MLO offered it would be a good tool.

What sets it apart from every other to-do list manager I've tried (and I've tried 20+ applications) is the to-do list. When you create a task you assign it places (contexts in GTD speak) - like: Home, Office Office Calls, etc. In the to-do list view you filter by place, so you only see the tasks that you can do at the current moment. For example I'm currently sitting at my office desk so I see all the places related to my Office. There are tools to focus on a branch in the outline, to limit places to visible at certain times, etc.

There are two other key aspects a very active user community (on Google groups) and developer who is listens and constantly improves the program to fit its userâ€™s needs.

So if you were like me, always chasing bits of paper then stop reading this review and try: My Life Organized: https://www.mylifeorganized.net/. Available as both a Windows and PocketPC application (N.B. some enterprising users have got MLO to work on the Mac and Linux with WINE).

There. One task on my list is complete. Four to go.
