![](images/agile-2009-conference-logo.png) Last year I did the [Agile 2008 Post Roundup](/blog/agile-2008-post-roundup.html), so I thought it might be fun to do this again this year. As usual, [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/agile2009/) has a number of items, including presentations and now MP3 downloads.

I hope you have as fun reading this as I did. If I missed your post, sorry. I scanned through the top 200 Google hits and a number of Twitter references, but in the end there is only so much I can read.

_One last thought – it was difficult to find proper names for everyone I quoted. Please make it easier – your name should be featured on the main page of your blog; if not there, then at least on the about page. Also, if you want to make your blog easy to quote, check if post titles can be easily selected. Do they link back to themselves, or do I have to get the link as well?_
