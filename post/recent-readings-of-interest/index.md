At the suggestion of a friend, from time to time I'm going to post about Recent Agile (or related) articles that I've read and found interesting.

[Yet another misunderstanding of TDD, testing, and code coverage](external:https://www.agileadvice.com/2008/11/04/uncategorized/yet-another-misunderstanding-of-tdd-testing-and-code-coverage/#comment-2024) - In examining the failings of Kevin Pang's "[Is Code Coverage Really All That Useful?](external:https://www.kevinwilliampang.com/post/Is-Code-Coverage-Really-All-That-Useful.aspx)" - Christian Gruber provides an excellent description of the real value of Code Coverage in Unit testing

At the Scrum Gathering in Stockholm, Bas Vodder presented: Problems with component teams - where he explains why Feature Teams are better than Component teams. Related from InfoQ: [Choose Feature Teams over Component Teams for Agility](external:https://www.infoq.com/articles/scaling-lean-agile-feature-teams).

[A Leaner Start: Reducing Team Setup Times](external:https://www.infoq.com/articles/pat-kua-onboarding-new) - from last year, Patrick Kua wrote about reducing the time and pain involved in introducing new members to the team.

[Testability Explorer: Measuring Testability](external:https://misko.hevery.com/2008/10/21/testability-explorer-measuring-testability/) from Misko Hervey - the tool itself is here: Testability Explorer - I'm not sure how I feel about this tool yet since some of Misko's claims in his talk don't sit well with me yet. Specifically he suggests no use of statics at all ever - never again calling Math.Abs() directly. Hmmmm.

Keith Braithwaite - has a interesting presentation on some measurement work he did. [Measure for Measure](external:https://www.keithbraithwaite.demon.co.uk/professional/presentations/#measure4). Its a bit hard to read by itself - but the key message for me: projects that have automated Unit tests have less complex code.

Mark Shuttleworth of Ubuntu fame mentions the use of [TDD](external:https://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/150) in the development of their distro.
