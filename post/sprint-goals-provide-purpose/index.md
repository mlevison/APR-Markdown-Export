## Go Beyond Merely Completing Work Lists with a Sprint Goal

Research shows that people, whether acting individually or as a team, achieve more when working toward an objective that is specific, challenging, and concrete.\[[1](#footnotes)\] For that, we need clear Sprint Goals.

A Sprint should be so much more than just completing a number of User Stories or fixing bugs. If your Sprints are merely about ticking off items on a scattered work list without having a shared understanding of why they‚Äôre important or what purpose they serve, [your Development Team](/blog/scrum-development-team-whos-in-it) will struggle to keep focus in the short-term and will take longer to [become highly effective](/blog/5-steps-for-creating-high-performance-teams-ebook) in the long run.¬†Sprint Goals provide purpose for the Scrum Team to work together effectively.

## What does the _Scrum Guide_ say about Sprint Goals?

As part of Sprint Planning it says:

> _The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning._

As far as typical standards of the _Scrum Guide_ go, this is clear üôÇ. Key takeaway is that it‚Äôs about the value that the team will deliver in Sprint and it should help the stakeholders. This is going to be a handy measuring stick when we test bad Sprint Goals.

The _Scrum Guide_ is also neatly answering questions that frequently come up in workshops:

**When is the Sprint Goal set?** During Sprint Planning.

**Who is involved?** The whole Scrum team, meaning Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developers.

**Should the Product Owner set the Sprint Goal?** No. It‚Äôs good for them to go into Sprint Planning with some business or product objective in mind, but it‚Äôs through negotiation with the Development Team that the actual Sprint Goal emerges, as all grow towards a shared understanding of what is desirable and achievable in the Sprint. ‚ÄúAchievable‚Äù means possible to accomplish while upholding the quality agreed to in the Definition of ‚ÄúDone.‚Äù

**Does the Goal Change in Sprint?**¬†It‚Äôs very hard to hit a moving target, so the answer is no, the goal does not change within each Sprint. However at the start of each Sprint, the team sets a new goal.

**Are Sprint Goals optional?** The _Scrum Guide_ is clear on this, goals aren‚Äôt an optional part of Scrum. As we will see below, there occasions where goals aren‚Äôt practical, but they are still part of the game.

## Why Do We Have Sprint Goals?

In Scrum, we ask a Team to undertake¬†Sprint Planning¬†to agree on what they will achieve in the next Sprint, based on their expected capacity. As an outcome of this, the team should leave their planning session with a clear goal.

This provides stable direction, with flexibility to re-evaluate work, throughout the Sprint. It is the WHY of a Sprint, establishing purpose and commitment.

By participating in setting a Goal, Team members experience a sense of ownership of it and gain a better understanding of the overall problem. On occasion, it also helps them find better solutions than originally planned because that overall perspective can help see things during the Sprint that aren‚Äôt obvious if looking only at the individual parts.

The¬†Sprint Goal¬†provides focus in¬†Daily Scrum¬†and an opportunity to refocus if the Sprint goes off-track. When distractions occur (e.g. new User Stories or other outside interference), a clear goal gives Team Members a way of saying ‚Äúno‚Äù. They ask the question ‚ÄúWill this new thing help us get closer to the Sprint Goal?‚Äù If not, the distraction gets set aside and, if still relevant, considered in the next Product Backlog Refinement session.

Finally, jointly identifying and achieving shared goals is a key element for growing a group of people from a working group to a true team.\[[2](#footnotes)\]

## When Not to Use Sprint Goals in Scrum

Sometimes a team will have a Sprint of work with no focus. If this is rare, I wouldn‚Äôt try to set a Sprint Goal. Rather, I would acknowledge that, on this occasion, there isn‚Äôt a Sprint Goal. I have seen teams using Scrum to serve the needs of 4-5 distinct clients in a single Sprint. If their needs don‚Äôt have any overlap, then the team will not be able to set a Sprint Goal. Lacking a goal, this team will have a longer path to high performance. (I wouldn‚Äôt abandon Scrum altogether - see [Limits of the Framework](/blog/what-are-the-limits-of-the-scrum-framework)). However, the key point is that this should be a _rare_ occurrence, not license to skip Sprint Goals normally.

## Spotting Unhelpful, Meaningless Sprint Goals

In my experience, most Sprint Goals are not clear. Some poor examples I‚Äôve seen are:

- Fix 10 bugs ‚Äì _This lacks any sense of purpose. Why is it valuable to fix this batch of bugs vs any other bugs that are in the system?_
- Finish 7 unrelated User Stories ‚Äì _Similar to the previous example, there is no sense of purpose._
- Complete the work assigned to the team in JIRA ‚Äì _Yes, this is remarkably anti-Agile and ineffective, however, I see it all too often. This implies the team is a group of robots whose job it is to move a task from one column on [Sprint Backlog](/blog/the-humble-sprint-backlog) to another._

None of these examples help focus the Team. Nor do they clarify the value the team will deliver. The best test to spot unhelpful, meaningless Sprint goals is when the Stakeholders have no idea what they‚Äôre getting at the end of the Sprint.

## How to Make Better Sprint Goals

So, what makes a better Sprint Goal? A good Goal answers questions such as: Why is it worthwhile to undertake this Sprint? Are we attempting to solve a problem? Are we implementing a feature or clarifying an assumption?

Improved versions might include:

- Reduce the shopping cart abandon rate from 50% to 30% by improving usability and performance ‚Äì _Solves a problem. We‚Äôre losing sales because we have a poor checkout experience._
- Add filters to the existing product search results so that buyers spend less time finding items that meet their needs ‚Äì _Implements a feature._
- Offer free shipping for orders over $40 ‚Äì _Tests an assumption that free shipping will increase the amount people spend per transaction._

Agile Coach Bob Galen suggests that you imagine crafting an email to invite your whole company to your Sprint Review. What will you put in the subject line and first few sentences to entice them to attend?\[[3](#footnotes)\]¬†Then use that as your clue for your Sprint Goal ‚Äì the shared understanding created between the Product Owner and the Development Team of the desired outcome of the Sprint.

**Want to have a better understanding of the _why_ and _how_ of more things in Scrum, and not just the book-level _what_?** Practising Scrum without proper understanding can bring poor results and, ultimately, frustration and resistance. In our Certified ScrumMaster workshops, attendees learn in a fun and non-judgmental environment how to make Scrum work effectively in the real world, not just in principle.
