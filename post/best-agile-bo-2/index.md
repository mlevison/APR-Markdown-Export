The third and final my [Best Agile Books the 2007 Edition](/blog/best-agile-book.html) series. (Part II was [Background Material](/blog/best-agile-bo-1.html)). There will be even fewer notes than there were in yesterday's. It really has been a long week.

**Development/Code Related**

[Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052/&tag=notesfromatoo-20) by Michael Feathers - Do you have legacy code? Does your code include areas that are untested and tightly coupled? Yes? Then you have legacy code. Michael focuses on the problem of teasing apart legacy

[Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Technology/dp/0201485672/&tag=notesfromatoo-20) by Martin Fowler et al - One of the original Agile related books. It defines the concept of refactoring (personal bugbear - refactorings are small changes that don't affect the behavior of the code), explains how to practice it and catalogs over 70 refactorings.

[Test Driven Development](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321146530/&tag=notesfromatoo-20) by Kent Beck - The original TDD book. Clean, bug free, simple code. That is the promise of TDD. Its that simple nothing more to say. BTW the examples are in C# so some of the details won't apply to Java/Ruby/Python coders.

_Late Breaking news: J.B. Rainsberger introduced me to:_ [Test Driven: TDD and Acceptance TDD for Java Developers](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Acceptance-Java-Developers/dp/1932394850/&tag=notesfromatoo-20) by Lasse Koskela. I'm only about 120 pages in, but so far am very impressed. Its even caused me to change a few of my habits - specifically which test I choose to write first.

_Another Late Breaking item - Robin Dymond gave this one a very strong recommendation:_ [xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code](https://www.amazon.com/xUnit-Test-Patterns-Refactoring-Addison-Wesley/dp/0131495054/&tag=notesfromatoo-20) by Gerard Meszaros. I've not read this yet - but Gerard covers Test Smells and Refactoring. In other words how to spot trouble your test code and repair the damage.

[Refactoring to Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Patterns-Addison-Wesley-Signature-Kerievsky/dp/0321213351/&tag=notesfromatoo-20) by Joshua Kerievsky. Have mess, want to bring some order to it.

[Head First Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns/dp/0596007124/&tag=notesfromatoo-20) by Elisabeth Freeman (et al). I struggled through the [Original GOF Design Patterns book](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0201633612//&tag=notesfromatoo-20) twelve years ago now. Thankfully Elisabeth and co. wrote a funny, irreverent and so you don't have to.

What are your favorite Agile Books?

Coming up posts on: Iteration Length (another lesson learned that I didn't think of in my original post) and Pair Programming vs. Code Reviews a rebuttal.
