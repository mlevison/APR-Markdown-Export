![You help We help together for peace in Ukraine](src/content/page/global-community/images/Ukraine.jpg)

Our vision is to help others with challenges that they face in Scrum and Agile, but our hearts right now are consumed with grief for colleagues, friends, and the citizens of Ukraine as they face challenges most of us can’t begin to imagine. We know that many people will die, many more will suffer, and there is little we can do, so we're asking for your help to do more.

We have placed our own donations for aid to the people of Ukraine and we ask that you consider doing the same if you’re able.  **If you make a donation of $100** CAD or more, please send us some kind of 'soft' proof of it (using a simple honour system, e.g. screenshot of 'thank you for your donation' confirmation page) so **we can amplify the goodwill and give you a $100 discount** code off any upcoming training workshop, no exceptions, no expiry. Here are some of the charities that were suggested by _The Globe and Mail_:

- [Canadian Red Cross:](external:https://donate.redcross.ca/page/100227/donate/1?_ga=2.125878541.1041674209.1645872049-1232769696.1645872049&_gl=1*1ro22jf*_ga*MTIzMjc2OTY5Ni4xNjQ1ODcyMDQ5*_ga_376D8LHM0R*MTY0NTg3MjA0OC4xLjAuMTY0NTg3MjA0OC4w) the local wing of an international emergency-relief organization.
