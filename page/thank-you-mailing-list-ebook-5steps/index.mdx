You can also access material for a corresponding [High-Performance Teams Game](/blog/welcome-to-the-high-performance-teams-game).Â The game was developed to help teams see the effects of choices/tradeoffs on productivity and team cohesion. Rounds represent Sprints, and a roll of the dice may have things go smoothly, or... not so much.

We hope you will feel free to [contact us](/contact-us) to ask questions and share your feedback! The e-book and game will be updated from time to time with improvements developed from your suggestions. Your subscription entitles you to receive those future updates.

Thanks again!
