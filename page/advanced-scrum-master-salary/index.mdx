To perform these roles effectively and deliver the highest value, you need the Scrum Master skills that are best developed with our Advanced Certified ScrumMaster training in Scrum tactics and the Agile mindset, and even Lean Software Development methodology. Taking advanced Scrum Master training to become an Advanced Certified Scrum Master ([A-CSM](/advanced-certified-scrummaster-acsm-training)) not only improves your skills and understanding of the Scrum framework and Agile principles, but also improves your chances of advancing in your career and earning a better salary.

Let’s dive in!

## Earning Potential for ACSMs

An A-CSM professional has gone one step beyond a Certified Scrum Master (CSM) in the Scrum Alliance® Scrum Master track because they’ve completed advanced training in Scrum and the Agile methodology to earn the much-coveted advanced A-CSM certification. Consequently, the typical salary of an A-CSM is higher than that of a CSM.

## What Determines How Much an A-CSM Should Earn?
