Are you about to step into the realm of Agile approaches and enhance your professional credentials as a Certified Scrum Master (CSM)? If so, you're about to embark on a rewarding journey. In this article, we'll outline the requirements and steps you need to achieve this widely recognized certification.

The Scrum Alliance, the original and leading Agile certification body, facilitates the Certified ScrumMaster® certification. The certification is designed to ensure that you understand Scrum practices, values, and roles. More importantly, it also equips you to become a change agent in your organization, helping drive the shift toward Agile ways of working.

Let's demystify the path towards becoming a Certified Scrum Master:

1. ## Attend a CSM Course
    
    The first step towards earning the CSM certification is to attend a two-day training course led by our Certified Scrum Trainer (CST), Mark Levison. This course provides comprehensive insight into the Scrum framework. The training is interactive, blending theoretical instruction with practical exercises to ensure that you understand not only the 'what' and 'why' of Scrum but also the 'how'. [How long is scrum master training?](/how-long-is-scrum-master-training) Typically the formal CSM course happens over two days, but the practical training and learning is life-long.
2. ## Understand Scrum
    
    While attending the training course is mandatory, it's equally important to spend some time beforehand familiarizing yourself with Scrum. Reviewing the official Scrum Guide and additional Scrum literature, participating in Scrum communities, or even observing Scrum practices in your current organization can provide valuable context and understanding.
3. ## Pass the Scrum Master Certification Exam
    
    After completing the course, you'll need to pass the CSM exam. This online test consists of 50 multiple-choice questions, and you'll need to score at least 74% to pass. The questions are rooted in the Scrum Guide and the material covered during your training. Please don’t stress about this exam - the hard part isn’t the exam, it’s doing Scrum in real life.
4. ## Accept the Scrum Alliance License Agreement
    
    Once you pass the exam, you'll need to accept the Scrum Alliance's license agreement to officially become a Certified Scrum Master. Following this, you'll be listed on the Scrum Alliance website's global database of CSM professionals.
5. ## Maintain Your Scrum Master Certification
    
    The CSM certification is valid for two years. To maintain it beyond this period, you'll need to earn Scrum Education Units (SEUs) through ongoing education and professional development. We offer several free resources on this site to help you obtain your required SEUs.

It's essential to note that the [certified scrum master training and certification](/certified-scrum-master-training-and-certification) is about much more than the certificate itself. It's about understanding and embracing the Scrum values and principles and applying them to drive effective teamwork and deliver high-value outputs. As a Certified Scrum Master, you're not just a team facilitator, but a key player in fostering an Agile culture in your organization.

In addition, becoming a certified scrum master can significantly enhance your professional standing. In a global market where Agile approaches are rapidly being adopted, having a Certified ScrumMaster® certification signals to employers your commitment to Agile values, your understanding of Scrum, and your ability to coach Scrum teams effectively. Furthermore, as a CSM, you join a global community of Scrum and Agile practitioners, offering countless opportunities for learning, networking, and professional growth.
