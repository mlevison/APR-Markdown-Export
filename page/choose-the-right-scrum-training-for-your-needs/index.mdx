### Struggling to decide whether to take the ScrumMaster or Product Owner training?

First, know the problem that you’re trying to solve, then let that guide you. The [ScrumMaster](/certified-scrummaster-csm-training "Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) Training") workshop helps grow a great team that can build a high quality product rapidly. The [Product Owner](/certified-scrum-product-owner-cspo-training "Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) Training") course is all about working with the customers, stakeholders, and development team to determine which product to build.

A simplified explanation of the differences between our two most popular courses:

#### ScrumMaster (CSM) training

##### Who Should Attend

Individual Contributors (Developer, Tester, BA)

ScrumMasters

Product Owners

Traditional Project Managers

Mid-level Executives, etc

- usually the best fit for anyone new to Scrum
- focuses on the role of the team and the ScrumMaster (touches on Product Ownership but only as part of the big picture)
- understand the _how_ and _why_ of Scrum (not just the _what_)
- designing retrospectives that help teams overcome problems
- coaching your team through challenges, and how to coach your Product Owner
