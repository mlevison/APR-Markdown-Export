Thank you for joining the Advanced ScrumMaster email series list, where we will share tools and resources to help you guide your team through improvements and challenges to become truly high-performing.

If you're not already a subscriber, you will see a confirmation email in your Inbox shortly. Please click the confirm link as this is our way of combatting spam. (We hate it as much or more than anyone!)

You should see the first email in this Advanced ScrumMaster series in a day or so. If you don't, [let us know](/contact-us).

Please consider whitelisting us so these emails don't end up in your Junk filter.

Cheers!
