Scrum is an Agile project management framework that helps teams structure and manage work processes through principles. It encourages people to learn through experiences, solve problems strategically, and gain insights for constant improvement.

A Scrum Master plays a crucial role in facilitating the practices of the framework and ensuring that teams adhere to its values. Becoming one requires training and certification; the most important certification (and [one of the highest-paid Scrum certifications](/what-is-the-highest-paid-scrum-certification)) is the [advanced Scrum Master certification (A-CSM)](/advanced-certified-scrummaster-acsm-training), a credential you can pursue with help from Agile Pain Relief.

## What Is Scrum Certification?

Scrum certification is a highly sought-after credential acknowledging a person’s knowledge of Scrum principles and Agile methodologies. It’s a designation that demonstrates the characteristics of an effective Scrum Master and one’s understanding of the fundamentals of Scrum. It also shows a person’s ability to lead teams toward creating products and achieving goals with high efficiency and accountability.

## Why Earn Scrum Certification?

Earning a Scrum certification is excellent for project managers and team leaders who want an edge on their resume, improve their day-to-day tasks, and open themselves up to more career opportunities. Here’s an overview of the benefits of getting certified in Scrum:

### Proficiency Validation and Industry Recognition

Scrum certification proves one’s proficiency in Agile and Scrum concepts and substantiates an ability to put these into practice. A person with the credentials earns prestigious recognition in the industry, making them more valuable in the eyes of employers.

### Elevated Project Efficacy

Scrum certification teaches one how to work with a team more effectively and efficiently. It teaches better organization, direction, collaboration, and problem-solving and strengthens a person’s risk assessment skills. These prevent bottlenecks and issues that could otherwise stall projects or waste time and resources.

### Increased Career Opportunities

Scrum certification can increase job opportunities and open candidates to commensurate salary raises. It shows an enduring commitment to acquiring knowledge, which sustains a competitive edge in the job market.

## Scrum Master Certification

Scrum Master certification is the entry-level recognition for Scrum professionals, and it’s often considered the most important credential to getting one’s foot in the door regarding the Agile methodology. That said, a step further can make a load of difference.

The program provides students with the foundation and support needed to drastically increase their effectiveness and efficiency in pushing teams toward achieving goals and obtaining milestones–all through a comprehensible, experience-backed, and practical educational approach.

## How to Become Scrum-Certified

The first step to becoming Scrum-certified is to understand the fundamentals of Scrum, familiarizing oneself with the framework’s roles, events, and artifacts. To take this a step further, one should enroll in training, like Agile Pain Relief’s A-CSM training to gain a more in-depth know-how of the methodology, its values, and its practices, and how these apply to real-world cases.

With this comes choosing the right certification. Multiple certifications are available catering to specific roles and skill levels, and it’s important to know which aligns with an individual’s career goals.

After education and training, gaining hands-on experience through sample projects implementing Scrum practices is best. This will also work as a review for Scrum course exams, through which one can receive certification after passing.
