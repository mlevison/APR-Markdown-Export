## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Does the course registration fee include exam fee and membership?

Yes, it includes any applicable exam fees (currently only CSM has an exam) and two years of ScrumAlliance membership.

#### What will we need for the in-person Scrum training?

Just yourself and an open mind. And maybe your favourite pen, but we'll also have lots of those. Workbooks will be provided to you in class but they're more for later reference and you won't be using them much. We'll have shorts breaks with healthy snacks and coffee/tea. You're on your own for lunch.

#### What will we need for the online Scrum training?

An internet connection and computer system that can handle video conferencing and multiple applications at once (e.g. Google Docs, Mural, Zoom), a webcam and microphone (your computer's built-in mic is fine), and a browser that is \*not\* I.E. (Chrome and Chrome-based browsers, Firefox, Safari should be fine.)

#### Will a virtual course still qualify for certification?

Yes. It will still have Certified Scrum Trainer Mark Levison as the instructor and it will still be live and interactive, and cover all the curriculum that the Scrum Alliance requires for certification. In general, the training won’t be a lot different than our in-class workshops, except that you’ll have to make your own coffee.

#### **What is the best course for me?**

If you're struggling to decide whether to take the ScrumMaster or Product Owner training, [this might help](/choose-the-right-scrum-training-for-your-needs "Choose the Right Scrum Training for Your Needs"). It's not unusual for people to take both CSM and CSPO training to have a broader, and more effective, understanding of both roles.

Registration is non-refundable less than 10 business days prior to course start. **If you absolutely can no longer attend, we strongly encourage you to transfer your registration rather than cancel, as outlined below.**

#### Registration Transfers

Transferring a registration to an alternate course date can be done up to 10 business days prior to the start date of the original course. Requests received less than 10 business days prior are not possible. We allow one change in date for free; additional changes will incur a 20% fee.

If you do not attend the course and do not notify us in advance to discuss, registration is non-refundable and non-transferable. In the case of unforeseeable events such as medical emergencies, please contact us and provide as much detail and documentation as possible, and we will work together to find an appropriate solution.

## Course location to be confirmed and may be subject to change

We make every effort to guarantee our course dates, however some things are beyond our control. In the event that we are forced to cancel a course for reasons including, but not limited to, trainer illness or weather-restricted travel, we will offer your choice of full refund or credit toward a future course.
