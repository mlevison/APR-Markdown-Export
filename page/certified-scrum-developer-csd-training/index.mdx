![5000 testimonials](src/content/page/certified-scrum-developer-csd-training/images/5000-Testimonials.png)

_"Mark is an awesome instructor... definitely the Yoda of the Scrum universe." - Ting-Yu Lin_

How many of these sound like something you’ve heard (or even said) in your workplace?

“We commit at the beginning of every Sprint and rarely meet that commitment by the end."

“Our programmers say the word refactor, just before they disappear off on their own for a few days. Is this what they’re supposed to do?”

“We get lost in the details and are struggling to go from User Stories to Acceptance Criteria.”

![Certified Scrum Trainer Mark Levison](src/content/page/certified-scrum-developer-csd-training/images/Mark-Levison-headshot-600x800-transparent-badges-225x300.png)Hello, I’m Mark, and I’m a recovering software developer \[tongue-in-cheek\]. I know your pain, because I’ve either lived it myself, or I’ve helped others through it.

As a Developer, in 2001 I discovered that the general practices I was instinctively drawn to and doing had a name: Agile. Since then, I’ve read hundreds of books, thousands of articles, and mittfuls of academic papers, all with the purpose of figuring out what helps teams succeed. I don’t teach theoretical principles. I use my decades of experience to relate directly with Developers about their codebase, and can walk you through exactly how you can apply Agile to “Yes, but in the real world…” situations.

Having introduced Scrum, Lean, and Agile methodology to thousands of professionals –from individuals to small start-ups to major institutions and national government– I can assure you that you’re not alone in your frustration, and that your concerns are valid.

_"Mark is the real s\*\*t. He's lived through the pain points and knows where the bodies are buried." — Christian Farley_

You can choose between two very different types of Certified Scrum Developer training so you can choose which is best suited for you. Both qualify for Scrum Alliance certification.

## If you’ve not written code in Java, C# or other modern programming language  
then our [Non-Technical CSD workshop](#nontech) is designed for your needs.

![arrow icon](src/content/page/certified-scrum-developer-csd-training/images/noun-arrow-1144336-F1584B.png)

## If you read the following pain points and think, yes, that’s my world,  
then you would benefit from attending our [Technical CSD training](#nontech).

- What makes a good Unit Test? How do I write them?
- Our Unit test suites run slow. They take 20mins to run – what do we do? (We’ve helped clients with hours-long test suites)
- I’ve heard of TDD, is it possible to practice it without a massive slow down?
- Our code base is a mess. How do we recover without disappearing for 6 months for a complete rewrite?
- We have lots of Unit Tests but not much to test the behaviour of our system. What do we do?

**Both Non-Technical and Technical Certified Scrum Developer workshops** meet or exceed all requirements for Scrum Alliance certification.  But we won’t just be running through a list of boring learning objectives. You don’t retain what you learn for long if it’s dry and theoretical so, instead, you will learn and practice Scrum and Agile development techniques while building a product.

**We make learning fun, and practical for your everyday work.**

The differences between the technical and non-technical workshops are outlined below, but by the end of either course, you will understand all of these Agile engineering practices:

![Agile Engineering Practices](src/content/page/certified-scrum-developer-csd-training/images/Agile-Engineering-Practices-map-small.jpg)

That might look intimidating now, but through the magic of high-quality Scrum training, **this will make sense to you. We guarantee it!** And since your learning should be immediately valuable and relevant for your daily work, we will also play with AI’s (aka Large Language Models) and understand where they help and where they can harm.

## Non-Technical Certified Scrum Developer workshop

There will be no coding in this version of the course. We will spend our time together building a fictional product where we’ve got just enough funding to bring our product to market. Based on common, real-life scenarios, we will have a Product Owner who has created a clear product vision, and we will have a product backlog. We just need to get cracking. As we practice building product, we will learn what is hard. As with all our workshops, when we encounter something hard, then we take the time to hands-on learn new tools to handle the situation in an effective way, so you leave with practical experience and skills to help you navigate problems, and not just theoretical memorization of things to earn certification.

This workshop is ideal for Business Analysts, QA, User eXperience, etc who work as a part of a bigger team and will benefit from enhanced skills and practice in collaboration.

## Technical Certified Scrum Developer workshop

Code will be in both Java and .NET. In this interactive online class, we will use Github to share code and exchange learnings. All code in the workshop will be either pair programmed or done ensemble (aka mob) programming style. So if you’re a bit rusty, don’t worry, your teammates will help.

Starting with something classically messy, we will practice taking code that is a antiquated mess and bring it into a modern age. Then we will transition into building a product based on a vision and starting code base that we provide. We will work together to bring our product to “market”. Along the way, we will wrestle with the real challenges of dealing with legacy code, poor acceptance criteria, and questions of good design.
