## More About Scrum Masters

A Scrum Master is an individual who manages multifaceted projects and coaches Scrum teams using the Scrum framework. Although Scrum can be used in many industries, it’s commonly adopted by technology companies (especially software development companies) to facilitate and manage their software development projects more effectively and deliver value frequently and iteratively.

To become an Advanced Certified Scrum Master, you must demonstrate a strong understanding of the necessary skills and principles in Agile methodology and the Scrum Master framework. These skills are acquired through training and experience.

## How Long Does It Take to Become an Advanced Certified Scrum Master?

There are several prerequisites you must fulfill first before you can qualify for the A-CSM certificate.

To begin, you must first earn Certified ScrumMaster certification by successfully completing an accredited Certified ScrumMaster course with a Certified Scrum trainer (CST). The initial Certified ScrumMaster training course requires a minimum of fourteen hours of direct instruction, plus any preparation time. It offers an overview of Scrum, preparing you with the required knowledge and skills to perform the Scrum Master role.

You must successfully complete that Certified ScrumMaster training and pass its certification exam. In addition, you need a minimum of one year of experience in the Scrum Master role within the last five years before you can qualify for Advanced Certified ScrumMaster certification, however that experience can have been acquired before you took your CSM.

## Deepening Your Scrum Master Skills

Certified ScrumMasters can enroll in Advanced Certified ScrumMaster training to deepen their understanding of Scrum and learn new skills on how to coach Scrum teams effectively. Agile Pail Relief offers a live online course that is an immersive learning experience, spread over several weeks so you have time to actually practice the key Scrum concepts, skills, principles, and practical solutions for difficult, real-life scenarios and then apply them the next day, with follow-up support as needed.

Successfully demonstrating a deep understanding of the Scrum Master role and completing the Advanced Certified ScrumMaster training will earn you the Advanced Certified ScrumMaster certification. Your A-CSM certificate will be valid for a duration of two years with the Scrum Alliance, after which you can renew it for another two-year period by paying a renewal fee and logging the required Scrum Education Units.
