## Take a Scrum Master Training Course

### **Enroll in our next** [**Certified Scrum Master (CSM) course**](/certified-scrummaster-csm-training)**.** 

These courses are designed to provide hands-on experience with Scrum and a deep understanding of the Scrum Master role. Everyone adheres to the same learning objectives, so we cover similar topics. The Agile Pain Relief difference is that we focus on doing Scrum in the real world, not just in theory. As difficult questions come up on the fly in the workshop, we answer them. Far more importantly, we give you a plan so that when you return to the team after the workshop, you have a clear understanding of what’s next. We’ve created a safe place to learn and have designed the material to be playful. After you complete a training workshop, you might be afraid and unsure about where to go afterwards for answers? We have you covered, with a vibrant community of practitioners and monthly coaching sessions where people can join in and ask questions.

### **Do Some Preparation**

Don’t worry, we provide the preparation material for you. We don’t expect you to scour the internet to find good descriptions of Scrum. By having you do a little bit of reading in advance of the training workshop, we can save a great deal of time discussing the basic mechanics and move onto deeper problems, which will equip you to handle Scrum challenges in real life. 

### **Pass an Exam**

After completing the CSM course, you’ll need to pass an exam to [get your Scrum Alliance Scrum Master certification](/what-is-scrum-master-certification). The test typically includes multiple-choice questions about Scrum principles, roles, events, and artifacts. Remember, the exam is not just a test of knowledge but also an assessment of your understanding of Scrum and your ability to apply it. But with Mark’s unique training style, the vast majority of attendees pass easily on the first try. 

## Practise The Scrum Principles That You Learned

### **Focus on Your Team**

In Scrum, the focus is on the team, its dynamics, and its effectiveness. A Scrum Master is the team's guide on the side, not a traditional manager. You act without authority, as their coach and mentor.

To play the Scrum Master role well, investing in your people skills is crucial. Learn how to effectively communicate, facilitate, listen, ask powerful questions, resolve conflicts, and create an environment where the team can be productive.

### **Your Team’s Long-Term Health is More Important Than Its Velocity**

As a Scrum Master, you’ll be responsible for ensuring that the team follows Scrum principles and practices. However, it’s crucial to remember that the team’s long-term health and sustainability are more important than its short-term velocity. This means ensuring team members are not overworked, the quality of work is not compromised for speed, and the team continually improves its ways of working.

## How Long Does it Take to Become a Scrum Master?

Becoming a Scrum Master doesn’t happen overnight. The time it takes depends on your current knowledge and experience with teams and Agile approaches. For some, it might take a few months of dedicated learning and practice. For others, it might take a year or more. Remember, it’s not just about gaining theoretical knowledge but also about applying it in real-world scenarios. The hardest part isn’t understanding the core mechanics of Scrum. It is knowing how to work well with the people on your team without use of power. You’re just there as their coach and guide on the side, not their overlord.

## Scrum vs. Agile

It’s kind of confusing. Aren’t Scrum and Agile the same thing? No. Scrum is one of the original 7–8 frameworks that emerged in the mid ‘90s. Agile is the umbrella name for all of those frameworks. Scrum has a simple, clear set of rules which is seven  pages long. Agile has only four Value statements and twelve Principles, and it doesn’t even occupy a whole page. Agile isn’t a methodology, it is far more of a mindset.
