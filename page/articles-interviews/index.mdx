[Making TDD Stick: Problems and Solutions for Adopters](external:https://www.infoq.com/articles/levison-TDD-adoption-strategy/) Mark observed that, after solid classroom training, teams in larger companies still struggle to adopt TDD.

[Technical Debt a Perspective for Managers](external:https://www.infoq.com/articles/technical-debt-levison/): Developers often talk about Technical Debt saying it's slowing your projects down. What are they really saying? What measures can you take to reduce it before it cripples your projects? – Mark Levison, 2010

[The Science of Learning: Best Approaches for Your Brain](external:https://www.infoq.com/articles/science-of-learning/): Why don’t people understand your idea in a meeting? Why does the developer you’re mentoring still not get it? Why do attendees in your course only learn 10% of the material? We are all teachers in some way, yet only professional educators receive training in this area. This article discusses lessons from neuroscience and how they can be applied to Agile Software Development and beyond. – Mark Levison, 2010
