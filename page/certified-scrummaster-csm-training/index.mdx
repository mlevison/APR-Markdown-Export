_"Mark is an awesome instructor... definitely the Yoda of the Scrum universe." - Ting-Yu Lin_

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XFa2qThTMTk?si=a_ULTm9xj0CaBVWu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## At work have you ever…

-   Been pressured to deliver more, faster?
-   Had obstacle after obstacle put in your way?
-   Been frustrated at wasted time in team meetings?
-   Felt like you were part of a feature factory?
-   Been interrupted over and over, losing momentum and motivation on your project?
-   Had no idea what you were supposed to be building/doing?
-   Struggled to explain Scrum to your management team?
-   Felt management didn’t care (or, worse, didn’t trust you)?
-   Thought Scrum was a waste of time, or been told that it is?

## The problem isn’t you or your team.

You’ve read more articles and books than you can count about the Scrum framework and they contradict each other. Or just as it was getting to the key point, it became maddeningly vague. These didn’t work because most people treat Scrum as a magic formula, promising that if you follow all the theoretical steps in the spell, you will wondrously produce great product with more features, faster.

But you’re working in the real world, not a theoretical one. With real people: your team, managers, and customers. With that reality comes pressure, false urgency, and a host of other problems. It’s not your fault, nor your boss’s (most of the time) or the customer. The system that you’re part of creates these project outcomes. Fixing the problems isn’t easy; you need a plan that helps you find your path through the mess. This is where professional and high quality Scrum courses and Scrummaster certification come into play.

_"Mark Levison's teaching style is interactive and informative and really captures the essence off Scrum. I would recommend it to any company who struggles with the same issue we do - chaos!" – Philip Qumsieh_

_"As a self-employed business owner with a small team, this course was helpful in understanding how to improve my company's value to clients." – Murtada Shah_

Discount Scrum training gets you discount results.  
You can sit through boring PowerPoint and get your Scrum Master certification from a trainer who has never suffered through merge hell themselves, and who abandons you once the Scrum course is over, **OR...**

... you can discover for yourself why Mark Levison is considered an Agile and Scrum pioneer, and “the one to learn from” in Canada. He invests in your success and provides ongoing support and resources, above and beyond the Scrum Master certification training.

_"Insanely terrific. I have been bored silly at some Agile training classes. This was 100% interesting… okay, 98%. I get it now – the value of a \*real\* pro scrum master." — Simon Crum_

_"Mark is the real s\*\*t. He's lived through the pain points and knows where the bodies are buried." — Christian Farley_

## How to make work suck less with CSM certification.

We’ve been told that we shouldn’t use the word “suck” on a professional page. Maybe, but let’s be real, that’s why many people wonder about Scrum learning and certification in the first place, in the hopes that it will solve all their project problems that… well… suck.

### Are you looking for a Certified Scrum Master course?

We do certification, but if that’s all you want, you’re in the wrong place. A Scrum trainer can get you certified at bargain basement prices, but a digital badge isn’t going to help you with real world organizational problems or answering project questions. Discount Scrum certification won’t take away that fear of not knowing how to handle something. For that, **you want to learn from a professional Agile and Scrum expert so you understand Scrum at a level that is actually useful and practical to your work day.** Mark's online courses will give you a solid Scrum foundation and prepare to become Scrum master certified.

Mark gives you everything you need to earn your Scrum Master certification but then he takes Scrum many steps further. You know a project plan won’t work, so we give you a blueprint instead, and then guidance and support as you implement it and hit snags (hint: there are always snags with a project no matter how much experience or knowledge you have).

That’s just one way that Mark is different as a professional Scrum and Agile instructor, and the preferred choice of many major organizations and industries including government, software, banking, finance and education, to name only a few.

## You're going to have questions during the learning course,  
but also throughout your Scrum career after you settle into the real work.

-   What should I prioritize during my first days/weeks as a Scrum Master?
-   Are there common mistakes or pitfalls I should watch out for and avoid as a new Scrum Master?
-   How do I help with improvements and resolve conflicts during a project, without any power?
-   What do I do when organization management is making it impossible to succeed?

Learn the Scrum framework from someone who will help well beyond the initial course, when you have "yes, but in real life…" questions like those above. Don’t settle and pay for fast food Scrum courses when becoming a Certified Scrum Master. Invest in healthy, full-meal training, with take-home recipes for success and ongoing support during and after the certification course.

_"Anyone looking to do this course...do it with Mark! His passion for all things Scrum and Agile shines through and excites his students. He’s a scrum realist with a fantastic sense of humour! The material is relevant today and Mark gives us a glimpse of what we can expect 5 years from now. The post class support is fantastic and shows how passionate and knowledgeable Mark is about learning! A true educator!" – Roberta Potocnik_

_"Great! Fun! And I learned something too! Seriously, one of the best training sessions for my personal growth." – Pierre Versailles_

## Become a Scrum Master: FAQs

## What training is needed to be a Certified ScrumMaster?

You can be a Scrum Master without any training, sadly to say. Being a Scrum Master a tough position to throw anyone into without support and resources, but it’s not an uncommon occurrence. Many of our alumni students came to us for Scrum training because they had no idea what was expected of them or how to do a good job with their project and teams. Our students find that the online class helps prepare them for the CSM exam and to apply their Scrum knowledge to organization projects.

To be a _Certified_ ScrumMaster®, the Scrum Alliance requires that you attend and participate in at least 14 hours of CSM training delivered by a Certified Scrum Trainer and pass the certification exam.

None of that, including CSM certification, guarantees that you’ll [be an _effective_ Scrum Master](/how-to-become-a-scrum-master), which should be the goal far more than just holding the title as a Scrum professional. That’s why we believe in going above and beyond so the online training isn’t just a one-time thing. With Agile Pain Relief, you get included follow-up support and resources, and access to a whole professional community who help take you beyond merely being assigned a job and getting a CSM certificate. **We invest and provide continual learning so you can be effective and excel in your Scrum Master position.**

## Does a Scrum Master need to know coding?

No. While Scrum is popular in the world of professional software development, it’s also used successfully in many industries outside of that, including education, healthcare, and aviation, to name a few. Even in software, the Scrum Master does not have to be a programmer/developer. The Scrum expert's role is to be the coach for the team, not the coder.

## What do scrum masters do all day?

Serve their team. Not literally, like bringing coffee and running to the printer (although those are thoughtful too), but in the broad sense **a Scrum Master is a servant-leader**. They facilitate the various Scrum events and work with their team to identify obstacles, then help the team resolve them so they can perform efficiently while completing the project.

## What does scrum stand for?

Many assume that SCRUM is an acronym for something, but it’s not. You may have heard the term "scrum" before in reference to rugby, where it refers to a formation of players. A team that works together to move a ball toward a common goal. Don’t overthink it. The analogy works because of the simplicity of it in both contexts.

## What shouldn't a Scrum Master do?

Judge. Punish. Assign. Blame. Reward. Prioritize. Instruct. The list goes on. But perhaps one that will surprise many people is that **a Scrum Master should not solve problems for their team**. (Did that catch you off guard?) Instead, the Scrum Master should help their team identify issues and work together to resolve them. Subtle difference, but critically important.
