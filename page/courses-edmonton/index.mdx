In our Scrum Alliance [certification workshops](/certified-scrum-agile-training), students learn through practical exercises and examples to develop the knowledge, skills, and insights needed to make the shift from traditional management practices to Agile practices. Facilitated by [Certified Scrum Trainer™ Mark Levison](/about-us), an Agile expert since 2001, these workshops have a deep understanding of how people learn, and aren't a class with a bunch of words on PowerPoint slides. Local training means you also have the advantage of meeting and networking with other professionals near you to hear the challenges - and solutions - experienced by other organizations, which can be invaluable.

"Wonderful course and instructor. Fantastic mix of theory and pragmatism. Concepts applicable to non-software development. Very valuable. Well done!" ~ Margaret Uminska
