In a standard Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) training course you can expect to cover the minimum required learning objectives for Scrum Alliance Certified Scrum Product Owner certification. This training can be attended in-person or in an [online Certified Scrum Product Owner training](/can-the-certified-scrum-product-owner-class-be-done-online) class.  But in _high-quality_ CSPO training, like we offer here at Agile Pain Relief, you can expect much, much more than that.

In our [Certified Scrum Product Owner training course,](/certified-scrum-product-owner-cspo-training) you will gain expertise in several critical areas, including creating and managing a Product Backlog, establishing a clear product vision, collaborating effectively with stakeholders, prioritizing work items, and maximizing the value delivered by the Development Team. Throughout the two day workshop, you will learn - and practice - all that is required for Scrum Product owner certification from instructor Mark Levison, one of the oldest Scrum/Agile practitioners in Canada (he's been practicing since 2001, before Scrum was popular).

Each workshop is run using the principles of Scrum so you gain hands-on practice, and you can expect our training to delve deep into the Scrum framework, the role of the Product Owner, and the essential skills needed to excel in this position. The course is designed to be highly interactive and engaging, incorporating various activities, exercises, discussions, and real-life examples to provide practical insights into the Product Owner's responsibilities.

The course differs from the ScrumMaster workshop in that it doesn't involve any test. To be eligible for certification, you must actively participate and demonstrate understanding of the Scrum principles and practices. Engaging in discussions, asking questions, and collaborating with fellow participants will expose you to diverse perspectives on various challenges encountered in product development. The course offers a dynamic platform to share experiences and learn from one another, making the learning process fun and stimulating, rather than death by PowerPoint.

Our Certified Scrum Product Owner training goes beyond teaching theory and puts serious emphasis on understanding the _how_ and _why_ of Scrum Product Ownership, and not just the _what_. You will learn strategies and develop skills to handle real world challenges and create ideal customer outcomes, not just produce widgets. You will learn:

- Experimental techniques to determine the right product
- Tools to go from Product Vision all the way down to Acceptance Criteria
- Methods to help the team build the product you intended
- Understanding of the original intention of User Stories
- Forecasting tools and stakeholder discussion strategies
- And more…

Our Certified Scrum Product Owner training also provides continued support and resources, so you feel equipped to apply your new skills and start seeing the benefits right after the training.

Upon meeting the Certified Scrum Product Owner certification requirements, Mark will submit your name to the Scrum Alliance as eligible for the certification. Subsequently, you will receive an email invitation directly from Scrum Alliance to activate your membership and complete [the CSPO certification process](/cspo-certification-process).

Your CSPO certification will be valid for two years from the date of issue, after that you will need to pay a renewal fee to the Scrum Alliance as well as submit a list of Scrum Education Units (SEUs) demonstrating your commitment to ongoing Scrum education. You can earn SEUs by participating in educational activities related to Agile and Scrum. This requirement for continued certification ensures that Certified Scrum Product Owners stay up-to-date with the latest practices and continue to grow professionally in their Agile journey. Several no-cost options for earning Education Units are available on our website, including attending our monthly virtual meetups and engaging in the discussion process, and reading Mark’s blog posts and eBooks.

The CSPO certification training will provide you with tools and knowledge to help you in your role as Scrum Product Owner.
