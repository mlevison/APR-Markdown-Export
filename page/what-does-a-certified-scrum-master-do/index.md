The Certified Scrum Master is not the overseer of the Scrum team, nor their manager. Their role is centered on ensuring that the team embodies and abides by the core principles and practices of Scrum.

**1\. Promoting Scrum Adoption:** The first and foremost duty of a Certified Scrum Master is to ensure the principles and values of Scrum are understood and adopted not only by the Scrum team but also by the broader organization. They work to imbue every participant with an understanding of the Scrum theory, practices, governing rules, and underlying values. This responsibility also extends to the organization's broader stakeholders, ensuring they comprehend and appreciate the benefits and constraints of the Scrum approach.

**2\. Facilitating Scrum Events:** As a pivotal figure in the Scrum framework, the Certified Scrum Master is entrusted with the responsibility of facilitating the various Scrum events: Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-Ups (properly known as the Daily Scrum), Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospectives. Each serves as a critical activity in the Scrum development framework, fostering communication, ensuring a steady flow of work, and promoting collaborative problem-solving throughout the project.

**3\. Eliminating Roadblocks:** Impediments slow the pace of progress. The Certified Scrum Master identifies obstacles and coaches the team to find their own solutions. When impediments are outside of the team’s control/skills, the Scrum Master works with management to eliminate them.  Whatever the source of the roadblocks –be it technical glitches, resource shortages, or coordination issues– the Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that they get solved.

**4\. Safeguarding the Team:** In addition to being a facilitator and problem-solving advocate, the Certified Scrum Master also serves as the team's guardian by shielding the team from external distractions and potential disruptions so the team is able to remain focused on the tasks at hand for the current Sprint, thereby improving the chances of the team successfully meeting their Sprint Goal.

**5\. Coaching and Mentoring:** A Scrum Master is also a mentor and coach in that they help the group become a real Scrum team by fostering collaboration. Coaching extends to the Scrum Product Owner and assisting in refining the product backlog and preparing it for the upcoming Sprint(s). The CSM promotes an environment of Psychology Safety, where ideas can be shared freely without risk or judgement, which many studies suggest is the key ingredient for team success.

**6\. Encouraging Continuous Improvement:** Once a Sprint concludes, the Scrum Master facilitates a crucial event known as the Sprint Retrospective where the Scrum Team commit to learning from past performance and adapting strategies accordingly. This promotes a culture of continuous improvement, a hallmark of successful Agile teams.

**7\. Facilitating Stakeholder Communication:** A Scrum Master ensures that stakeholders external to the Scrum team remain well-informed about the team's progress, any challenges encountered, and how they're being addressed. Simultaneously, they manage expectations concerning the product or project under development, and balance stakeholder needs and desires with the realities of the development process.
