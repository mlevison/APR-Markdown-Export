title: "Is the Advanced Certified Scrum Master Certification Worth It?"

When evaluating whether Advanced Certified ScrumMaster (A-CSM) training and certification are worth the investment, consider that Certified ScrumMaster training teaches the basics of the Scrum framework and Agile methodology, but is limited in its range beyond that. The Advanced training (A-CSM) goes much further and helps Scrum Masters learn how to put Scrum principles into practice to build teams that deliver meaningful value in a collaborative way. Scrum provides structure for teams to self-organize and build a product in a way that delivers value to the customer quickly and incrementally, and can adapt if needs change or priorities shift.

Maybe your organization has already taken the leap into Scrum and has even helped team members receive the Certified Scrum Master (CSM) title. While the CSM course covers the overview and basics of Scrum and Agile, you may run into a few speed bumps that can quickly derail your efforts, such as challenging team dynamics, retrospectives that go off track, a product with no vision, and more.

[Advanced CSM certification](/advanced-certified-scrummaster-acsm-training) can help smooth out those bumps and keep your organization on track. An Advanced Certified ScrumMaster who has the benefit of effective training can take your Scrum team to the next level.

## If You’re a Certified ScrumMaster, Do You Need an A-CSM Certification?

If you already have CSM certification, getting A-CSM certification may seem redundant. However, the difference between an [Advanced Certified Scrum Master versus a Certified Scrum Master](/advanced-certified-scrum-masters-versus-certified-scrum-masters) is a much deeper and more effective understanding of how to build and coach effective Scrum teams.

An Advanced Certified Scrum Master has a deeper understanding of the Scrum and Agile principles and frameworks, and the A-CSM certification equips you with tangible strategies and skills. You will learn how to problem-solve, facilitate, and direct meaningful change with greater ease as an A-CSM. A-CSM certification is also the next step on your Scrum certification journey.

## Benefits of Earning Your A-CSM Certification

There are several benefits to becoming an A-CSM beyond how it can improve your teams and organization as a whole. Having up-to-date A-CSM certification can give you a personal advantage and teach you skills that will benefit you wherever your career takes you. By showing a commitment to Agile and Scrum methodologies, you will be able to market yourself as someone who is trained and educated on implementing and supporting these strategies.

### Open Up New Employment Opportunities

_**\* As of 2023 there are only a few thousand Advanced Certified ScrumMasters world-wide, so any discussion about salary data should be viewed with that understanding carefully in mind.**_ The [average Advanced Scrum Master salary](/advanced-scrum-master-salary) is above six figures, with the average salary for an A-CSM ranging between $118,000 to $130,000 annually, according to an Indeed.com 2023 post.

A-CSMs have better chances of gaining employment in other Scrum-oriented positions. As you research companies you are interested in, check to see if they utilize Scrum processes–they’re more likely to hire someone with expertise in Scrum than not. The Advanced Certified ScrumMaster® certification is also globally recognized, which opens more doors for opportunity.

### Cost-Effective Solutions

You can earn a Scrum certification that makes you equally qualified for Agile Coaching and Agile project management roles. Whereas earning a degree in project management can take both time and money!

You can complete an A-CSM technically in as little as two days, but then you’re left to figure out how to make things work in the real world. In an Agile Pain Relief A-CSM course, the training is spread out over a minimum of four weeks to allow you time to properly process and apply what you’ve learned, and gain valuable feedback right in the moment. You will gain the tools and knowledge you need to be more effective in the Scrum master role, with credentials that impress employers.

### Enhance Your Teams and Organization

All Agile and Scrum principles emphasize the importance of collaboration, teamwork, and adaptability. To successfully implement Scrum and Agile frameworks, you need to have the tools that help get every member of your team on board.

An A-CSM certification focuses on preparing you for the “How do we do that in real life?” problems of a Scrum implementation, such as: resistant team members, conflicting team dynamics, and differing motivations. This certification also equips you with the tools you need to navigate these challenges, and the developed skills can still apply even in environments where Scrum and Agile aren’t implemented!

## What Careers Use Scrum the Most?

A-CSM careers tend to lean into the project management arena, but being a top-notch project manager isn’t the top rung of the ladder! Other roles include:

- Agile coach
- Delivery lead
- Project lead
- Business analyst
- Software engineering manager
- Information technology program manager

These are just the tip of the iceberg. If you’re looking to advance your career and pursue positions in leadership, an A-CSM certificate will show employers you’re committed and ready.

## The Bottom Line

A-CSM certification is a great way to continue your Scrum journey by deepening your understanding of Scrum and Agile principles and strategies. By pursuing an A-CSM certification, you not only build marketable skills for yourself as a professional, but also have the knowledge and toolkit necessary to help your team become more effective and high-performing.
