## Scrum Alliance Scrum Master Certifications

Scrum Master certifications play a pivotal role in demonstrating credibility and expertise in the world of project management and Agile approaches. The Scrum Alliance is a not-for-profit group founded in 2001 and is the original – and most widely recognized - Scrum certifying body. Not all project managers need an [advanced CSM certification](/advanced-certified-scrummaster-acsm-training), but having at least the most basic Scrum Master certification is very beneficial. As a project professional, it’s important to determine if you want to become a Certified Scrum Master (CSM) and follow the Scrum Master track of Scrum Master certifications available.

Here are the most popular Scrum Master certifications:

### Certified Scrum Master

The Certified ScrumMaster ® (CSM®) certification is suitable for Scrum Masters, Project Managers (who want to evolve) team leaders and anyone else who wants to understand why their organization has added a role with a very strange title. If you hope to lead a cross-functional team and manage complex projects, you should consider starting this career path by attending training and earning a CSM certification.

### Advanced Certified Scrum Master

The Advanced Certified Scrum Master® (A-CSM®) certification is more advanced than the basic CSM certification. Once you acquire your CSM certificate–which introduces you to the basic Scrum practices, ideologies, applications, and values–your next step should be to enroll in A-CSM training.

An A-CSM course teaches you how to facilitate effective dialogues between your Product Owners, members of your Scrum Team, clients, executives, and stakeholders. You’ll also learn how to respond effectively to anyone who resists change.

When there’s little or no engagement and motivation in your Scrum teams, you’ll know what to do to help improve team morale, ensure psychological safety so team members can communicate openly and honestly without fear, and encourage conflict resolution and the sense of being a true team working collaboratively toward a common goal.

The course also teaches you how to promote engagement and a greater sense of accountability, obligation, and buy-in. Furthermore, you’ll learn to scale the Scrum framework and Agile ideologies beyond one team.

The A-CSM course enables you to build on the foundational knowledge of Scrum with improved implementation skills. An A-CSM certification will help to distinguish you from other Scrum Masters in the global job market.

You’ll stand out as a globally recognized Scrum Master and a member of the prestigious Scrum community. This certification gives you great value that every potential employer is looking for.

### Certified Scrum Professional Scrum Master

On the Scrum Master track, the Certified Scrum Professional Scrum Master® (CSP-SM®) certification is the highest level of accomplishment. Through CSP-SM training, you can challenge your team members to enhance how they apply the Scrum framework and Agile methodology for increased productivity and better results.

You will be a professional Scrum Master with demonstrable experience and proven familiarity with Scrum. The CSP-SM course helps you learn how to develop practical solutions to complex challenges and enhance your Scrum implementation strategies.

As the highest level of Scrum Master certification, the CSP-SM certification allows you to prosper as a project manager. With this certification, you’ll not be just a project manager but a professional team leader with exceptional project management and facilitation skills.

This level of certification also establishes a gateway toward Certified Scrum Trainer® (CST®), Certified Enterprise Coach ℠ (CEC℠), or Certified Team Coach ℠ (CTC℠) certifications.

## How to Advance to the Next Level of Scrum Master Certification

You need a qualified and experienced Certified Scrum Trainer to take you through the different courses and prepare you for the relevant certification requirement to attain the highest level of Scrum Master certification possible. Before you sign up for training, ensure that your trainer has extensive experience and understanding of the material and practices, and isn’t just teaching you theory to memorize. The certifications will not be useful to you unless you have the skills and knowledge to apply the learning in practical, real-life situations effectively. All training at Agile Pain Relief is done by Certified Scrum Trainer and Agile expert Mark Levison, who has decades of experience with Scrum.
