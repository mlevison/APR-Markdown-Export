Certified Scrum Product Owner training® (CSPO) and Professional Scrum Product Owner™ (PSPO) are two popular certifications for individuals who play the role of a Product Owner in Scrum teams. The most recognized Scrum certification is Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO), with Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO) in second place. They are offered by different organizations and have significant differences:

## Scrum Certifying Body:

\- [CSPO certification](/certified-scrum-product-owner-cspo-training) is offered by the Scrum Alliance, a non-profit organization focused on promoting Scrum and Agile practices. The Scrum Alliance is the original Scrum certifying body, founded in 2001. CSPO certification focuses on providing an understanding of the role of the Product Owner, and how to effectively apply Scrum in real life, including creating and managing a Product Backlog, defining a product vision, collaborating with stakeholders, and prioritizing work items to help the Development Team deliver effectively. CSPO workshops must be run by a Certified Scrum Trainer, and qualifying to be a trainer is a rigorous, multi-year process. Product Owner certification requires that a student actively participates in the training and demonstrates a high comprehension of the material.

\- PSPO certification is offered by Scrum.org, a for-profit organization that provides Scrum training and certification. They were founded in 2010, nine years after the founding of the Scrum Alliance. Certification requires a passing grade on an exam that tests your ability to read and memorize Scrum theory.

## Product Owner Curriculum and Training:

\- The CSPO certification involves at least 14 hours of training by a Certified Scrum Trainer (CST). The course covers essential Scrum concepts for the Product Owner's role and responsibilities within a Scrum team. The journey toward becoming a CSPO doesn't end with certification. With our Certified Scrum Product Owner training, you gain access to an ongoing support system that includes a supportive growing community of practitioners just like you, working through problems in the real world. We also supply with you with a comprehensive supply of resources for your continued learning.

\- The PSPO I certification is a certification exam online without any training.

## Product Owner Certification Renewal:

\- The Scrum Alliance requires CSPO certificate holders to renew their certification every two years by earning Scrum Education Units (SEUs) and paying a renewal fee. SEUs demonstrate the commitment to the core Scrum and Agile principles of continuous learning and improvement. We provide several free resources on this website to earn SEUs as well as to grow your skills and understanding of the Scrum Product Owner role.

\- Scrum.org does not require PSPO certificate holders to renew their certification. Once you achieve a PSPO certification, it is valid for life.

 

Both CSPO and PSPO certifications focus on the Product Owner role in Scrum, but they are offered by different organizations and have differences in training quality and comprehension requirements. The choice between CSPO and PSPO may depend on your personal preferences, the availability of training in your area, and your specific career goals and needs. It's essential to research both options thoroughly before deciding which certification is right for you.
