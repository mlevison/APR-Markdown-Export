Learning how to be an effective Scrum Master typically involved formal certification training. The first level, Certified Scrum Master (CSM) certification demonstrates your commitment to learning how to effectively apply the Scrum framework and Agile principles, and perform the Scrum Master role specifically.

Because there are different levels of Scrum certification, it’s important to understand what each level of certification offers so you can decide which is the most important Scrum certification you want to achieve for your personal career goals.

Aim for the [highest level of Scrum Master certification](/what-is-the-highest-level-of-scrum-master-certification) possible to give yourself access to greater learning and understanding, as well as career opportunities. Each Scrum certification demonstrates to potential employers your commitment to developing skills and experience to handle the most complex projects and, as such, Scrum certifications typically also improve your earnings.

## How Scrum Certification Can Boost Your Earnings

As a Certified Scrum Master, your salary can be higher than that of other professionals who aren’t certified because you will have gone through the rigorous training and testing required to become certified. Each subsequent level of certification deepens your understanding and expands your knowledge and skillset, helping you to stand out and be more sought after by organizations looking to transition to, or deepen existing, Agile practices.

For instance, if you have an [advanced certified Scrum Master (A-CSM) certification](/advanced-certified-scrummaster-acsm-training), your earning potential increases significantly because you have greater demonstrable skills in the Scrum framework and Agile methodology that most prestigious organizations are searching for.

Scrum certification will give you access to better employment opportunities as many companies worldwide are searching for certified Scrum Masters and Scrum Product Owners. Although it’s not always mandatory that every Scrum Master hold a Scrum certification, many companies require you to be certified for you to hold specific positions.

Advanced Certified Scrum Master certification will give you a competitive advantage in the global job market because there are very few people who hold this certification. (As of late 2023 there are only a few thousand Advanced Certified Scrum Masters world-wide.) There are even fewer Certified Scrum Professional Scrum Masters® (CSP-SM®),  as that is currently the highest level of Scrum Master specific certification. Obviously the more in demand the skills are, and the fewer people who hold the accreditation, results in the highest-paid Scrum certification.

Besides the financial benefits of Scrum certification, you’ll also enjoy more job satisfaction. Your ability to successfully implement the Scrum framework and promote teamwork, innovation, and ingenuity will bring you a great sense of fulfillment.
