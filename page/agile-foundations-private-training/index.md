## How do you make your organization more Agile?

We understand that it can be difficult to know where to begin, but we’re here to help. It’s normal to be confused at the beginning, especially when you hear lots of buzzwords – Scrum; Agile; Kanban; SAFe; TDD; Sprints – and you don’t know where they all fit in or what is best for your group.

Are some of your people resistant to change? Or maybe you have team members with differing levels of experience.

#### If your group has been trying to practice Agile for years, with disappointing and frustrating results, you’re not alone.

Adopting Agile is hard enough to start with. Trying to do it while dealing with regulations and or the mess dealt to us by COVID is a whole new level of hard.

While the details of your situation are unique to you, the core challenges probably aren’t. Getting everyone on board and working well together toward being more productive and better able to adapt to change (pandemic, anyone?) requires a solid foundation and understanding. It’s the best way to make change easy – not scary – and have everyone feel invested and engaged in the process – not like it was forced on them. And, like all foundations, starting off right will give you the greatest advantage for success.

Mark’s experience shines through when he “walks the walk” with practical, relatable information born from more than twenty years of experience doing Agile. He doesn’t stand at the front of a room (or, in the case of virtual, in front of a camera) and teach people. Mark uses discussion and collaborative exercises to help attendees practice how to take a product from vision right through to completion and delivery, and deal effectively with challenges along the way by using Agile concepts. All our workshops are run using a Scrum-like approach, so you get to experience what it feels like to be part of a Scrum team from the moment we start.

And because a learner’s journey isn’t complete at the end of a training workshop, we provide additional resources to ensure that they have the confidence to put their new skills and understanding into action so they can immediately start to see benefits.

If you’d like to discuss how we can help your organization become Agile, we’d be happy to schedule a no-obligation, free phone consultation with Mark, then provide you with a detailed proposal charting an action plan specific for your group’s needs. We’ll also include helpful resources that you can access and start to implement, whether you decide to book training or not.

We get it, change is scary and, if done wrong, can be very costly. We will help you implement change effectively, from the foundation up, so you receive the greatest return on that investment.

Please provide as many details as possible about your individual situation, so we can be best equipped to address your enquiry efficiently.
