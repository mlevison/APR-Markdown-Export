When you take [Certified Scrum Product Owner® (CSPO®) training](/certified-scrum-product-owner-cspo-training) with us, throughout the two day workshop, you will learn - and practice - all that is required for Scrum Alliance certification from instructor Mark Levison, one of the oldest Scrum/Agile practitioners in Canada (he's been practicing since 2001, before Scrum was popular). Included in the course registration is Scrum Alliance membership for two years, and that coincides with the first two years of your certification.

[A Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certification lasts for only two years at a time](/how-long-does-a-cspo-certification-last) but, don’t worry, renewing your CSPO certification is a straightforward process, and here's what you need to do:

1. 1\. Accumulate Scrum Education Units (SEUs): SEUs are like credits that you earn by participating in activities that enhance your knowledge and skills in Agile and Scrum. The Scrum Alliance requires a certain number of SEUs for renewal. These activities could include attending workshops, webinars, conferences, or even reading Mark Levison’s eBooks and blog posts. We offer a number of different free options under the “Resources” tab on our website.
2. Log Your SEUs: Keep track of the activities you're engaging in to earn SEUs and then log into  your account on the Scrum Alliance website and record them. It’s all done on a good faith basis that people will log only what they’ve actually done. Because, after all, lying and saying that you did something toward learning, without actually doing it, hurts only you and your team.
3. Pay the Renewal Fee: There's a renewal fee associated with extending your CSPO certification. Check the Scrum Alliance website for the current fee.
4. Submit Your Renewal: On the Scrum Alliance website, you'll find a section where you can submit your SEUs and pay the renewal fee. This step confirms your intention to renew your CSPO certification.

The above are the steps to renewing your CSPO certification before it expires, and the required SEUs should be easy to obtain because of your understanding of the importance of continuous learning about the Scrum Product Owner role. To be an effective CSPO, your journey starts with certification but continues and expands throughout your career. Stay engaged and informed through opportunities like our “Three Percent Better” online community. Learn from the experience of others like Certified Scrum Trainer Mark Levison, to ensure that you build strong skills in things such as general product management principles, UX design, Lean Startup methodology, and general communication and leadership. Such comprehensive training empowers Product Owners to make informed choices at every stage of the product development process, ultimately leading to greater success in the market.

It's important to stay proactive about renewal when your [Certified Scrum Product Owner certification gets close to expiry](/does-cspo-certification-expire). This way, you can ensure that your CSPO certification remains active without any interruption.
