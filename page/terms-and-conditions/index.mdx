### Cancellation & Refund Requests

If request for registration cancellation is received at least 10 business days prior to course start date, 100% of your registration will be refunded. Registration is non-refundable less than 10 business days prior to course start. If you absolutely can no longer attend, we strongly encourage you to transfer your registration rather than cancel, as outlined below. Cancellations due to government health mandates will of course be fully refunded.

### Registration Transfers

Transferring a registration to a different person for the same course date can be done at any time, at no additional cost. Transferring a registration to an alternate course date can be done up to 10 business days prior to the start date of the original course. Requests received less than 10 business days prior are not possible. We allow one change in date for free; additional changes will incur a 20% fee.

### Attendance

If you do not attend the course and do not notify us in advance to discuss, registration is non-refundable and non-transferable. In the case of **unforeseeable events** such as medical emergencies, please [contact us](/contact-us) and provide as much detail and documentation as possible, and we will work together to find an appropriate solution.

### Course Location

Course location to be confirmed and may be subject to change.

### Guaranteed Dates

We are committed to delivering top quality, reliable education, which is why we offer [guaranteed course dates](/guaranteed-course-dates).  In very rare cases, circumstances beyond our control may obstruct that promise. In the event of a family or health crisis, extreme weather or travel complication that makes it impossible for Mark to safely reach the training location, or similar unforeseen factor, we will notify attendees as quickly as possible and promptly process their choice of: a) full refund of all payments, or b) registration transfer to the future course of their preference.
